# PDCVARMYTH2022
MATLAB scripts and functions used to create all figures of the article "Partial Directed Coherence and the Vector Autoregressive Modelling Myth and a Caveat’ by L. A. Baccala and K. Sameshima. [https://doi.org/10.3389/fnetp.2022.845327]

[February 1, 2022]

The PDCVARMYTH2022 package is MATLAB routines and functions comprising Supplemental Material to illustrate on how to generate all figures of the article

* Luiz A. Baccalá and Koichi Sameshima (2022) ‘Partial Directed Coherence and the Vector Autoregressive Modelling Myth and
  a Caveat.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnetp.2022.845327)

## Installation and usage

The PDCVARMYTH2022 package contains MATLAB mfiles in and its subfolders that you may copy into your preferred working directory. Then run
startup.m in the command line window of MATLAB to set path and check for the requirement

`> startup`

In addition to verifying the path, it will check the existence of the required MATLAB toolboxes. All other routines, including data simulation and total PDC estimation are included. This is a standalone version.

To run all Examples, choose [1], and [0] otherwise

The figures it generates are similar to those in the paper. Differences are due to possibly different random seeds.

Once setup is done, you may run any Example individually, then you may want to examine the script for figure generation details.

`> Example1 | Example2 | Example3 | Example4`

This material will be incorporated in future releases of the AsympPDC package:
